# Problem Description
For this project, we are tasked with designing and implementing a comprehensive SQL database that models the University of Georgia (UGA) and its operations. Our goal is to create a data model that captures key aspects of university life, including students, faculty, courses, departments, events, and campus resources. The challenge is to ensure that the database is capable of handling the complexity of these interconnected entities while providing meaningful insights for managerial decision-making.
